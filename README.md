# VK Remove phone confirmation dialog

An userscript to remove annoying phone confirmation dialog that randomly blocks some VK pages. It has no close button anymore, so it is hard to cancel it.

Generally speaking, I hate when there are only choices like "Yes" and "Maybe later", and no option like "No", as in "I really mean no, and please don't bucking bother me anymore, thanks".
This VK confirmation is a clear example of that, and it is even more annoying, because there aren't even a "Maybe later" option.

This script fixes this inconvenience.

## Installation

* Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey addon to your Firefox or Chrome (ask google for instructions for other browsers)
* Just click [this link](https://github.com/makise-homura/vk-remove-phone-confirmation/raw/master/vk-remove-phone-confirmation.user.js), it will install user script to your Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey.
* Now, you'll never see this confirmation again, and you could change your phone number whenever you want, not when VK thinks it's time to do so.
* You may configure things like auto-update and other stuff in your Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey menu.
